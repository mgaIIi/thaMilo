# Hey there🔥

I'm Milo Galli and I'm currently a student at UNIGE (Università degli studi di Genova). I really like java and object oriented programming, I mean that's my jam!
Looking forward to become a professional programmer and as someone would say 
"May the force be with me🗡⭐️" on this journey.
